## Map<K,V>

## Main Topics:
- Set of key/Value:
  - It doesn't accept duplications of the key;
  - The elements are indexed by the key object(they don't have position);
 
 - Commom use: cookies, local storage, every key-value model;
 - Main implementations:
   - HashMap: Fastest and not ordered;
   - TreeMap: Slowest(red/black tree) and ordered by the compareTo of the object(or Comparator);
   - LinedHashMap: Elements have added order;
   - clear();
   - size();

- keySet(): returns a Set<K>;
- values(): returns a Collection<V>;
